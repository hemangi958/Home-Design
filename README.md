A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website. The term also refers to one or more pages always shown in a web browser when the application starts up.

## DESIGN
Good design is functional, beautiful, rational, and socially conscious. We design projects to enhance people's lives. There is great value to coming home and going to work in tranquil environments, void of information overload. Our clients are part of the creative process and an integral member of the design team, which allows our work to go beyond elegant, functional and beautiful, to become meaningful.
